Smart Dustbin - As a part of Team CON-SOL-E 4.0 I with my teammate Mr. Vishal Vakil worked on an idea of CON-SOL-E 3.0 of developing a smart dustbin. Using Ultrasonic sensor and Arduino we fetched the data related to the space left in the dustbin. The data was then sent to the local server with the help of ESP8266 WiFi Module and it was continuously updated on our server. The data can then be read by any PHP file and whenever the dustbin is full we can get the indication for collecting the waste. Further the dustbin was programmed in such a manner that whenever it is full and the car comes to collect the waste it automatically empties itself with the help of DC motor attached with the dustbin at its one end and this was made possible with the help of a Bluetooth module and limit switches.# Smart-Dustbin
